  "summary": "BuildRequest specified no requirements and explicitly called for no additional changes. The diff introduces new frontend and backend functionality (URL/session param utilities, admin token handling in actor creation, and a user-approval/access-control system in the Motoko backend), including modifications to files that were declared immutable and backend logic that was declared a non-goal.",

      "description": "Added URL parameter/sessionStorage utilities for extracting and persisting URL parameters (including hash/query parsing and clearing params from hash).",

      "description": "Changed actor initialization to read a secret/admin token from URL parameters and call backend initialization with that secret; added query invalidation/refetch behavior tied to actor changes.",

      "reason": "No new features were requested; additionally, backend changes were explicitly a non-goal ('Backend changes ... must not require Motoko/backend changes'), yet backend/main.mo was modified.",
